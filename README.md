# ViewModelExample
ViewModel is part of jetpack suite library, it used to hold the data that use in view. So whenever there are a configuration change such a rotate screen, the data will not destroyed and gone, but its remain the same because its save in View Model, since View Model is not affected by configuration change (ViewModel Scope)

ViewModelFactory is use to pass value in constructor in Cutom ViewModel

LiveData is use to make the view always get up to data whenever the data is changed
